## we make a cache for a matrix and then return the inverse of the matrix

## to set up a "List" to show the whole processes of making a matrix, and getting the inverse matrix:

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
     
}


##  to examine if the result (inverse matrix) of applied matrix had existed or not:

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
     
     ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
